description: Learn how to enable a style for a specific file type.

```ini
StylesPath = styles

[*.md]
BasedOnStyles = Vale, MyStyle
```

`BasedOnStyles` specifies styles that should have all of their rules enabled.

If you only want to enable certain rules within a style, you can do so on an
individual basis:

```ini
[*.md]
# Enables only this rule:
Style1.Rule = YES
```

You can also selectively disable rules from a style:

```ini
[*.md]
BasedOnStyles = Vale, MyStyle

Vale.Spelling = NO
```
