```ini
StylesPath = styles

IgnoredScopes = code, tt

[*.md]
BasedOnStyles = Vale
```

`IgnoredScopes` specifies inline-level HTML tags to ignore. In other words,
these tags may occur in an active scope (unlike `SkippedScopes`, which are
skipped entirely) but their content still won't raise any alerts.

By default, Vale ignores `code` and `tt` tags. For example, considering the
following Markdown file:

```markdown
This is a sentence that contains inline `code`.
```

Vale will not raise any alerts for the content within the backticks, such as
`code` in the example above.

See [Markup](/docs/scopes) for more information.
