| `ignorecase` | `bool`  | Makes all matches case-insensitive.                                       |
| `alpha`      | `bool`  | Limits all matches to alphanumeric tokens.                                |
| `tokens`     | `array` | A list of tokens to be transformed into a non-capturing group.            |
| `exceptions` | `array` | An array of strings to be ignored.                                        |
| `vocab`      | `bool`  | If false, disables all active vocabularies for this rule (default: true). |

`repetition` looks for repeated occurrences of its tokens.

```yaml
extends: repetition
message: "'%s' is repeated!"
level: error
alpha: true
tokens:
  - '[^\s.!?]+'
```
