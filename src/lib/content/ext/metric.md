<Alert>
When writing conditions, be sure to use floating-point numbers. For example,
use <code>"== 8.0"</code> instead of <code>"== 8"</code>.

| Name        | Type     | Description                                                    |
| :---------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `formula`   | `string` | A formula of pre-defined variables to be evaluated.            |
| `condition` | `string` | A binary condition upon which `formula` will trigger an alert. |

`metric` enforces arbitrary formulas based on pre-defined, built-in variables.

```

## Variables

The table below summarizes all available variables:

|       Variable       |                                    Description                                     |

Since the pre-defined variables are calculated using the entire document, all
`metric`-based rules are [`summary`-scoped][1].

## Operators

In addition to using the variables listed above, a `formula` may also use the
following operators:

|    Operator    |      Description      |
| :------------: | :-------------------: |
|      `+`       |       Addition        |
|      `-`       |      Subtraction      |
|      `*`       |    Multiplication     |
|      `/`       |       Division        |
| `math.sqrt(x)` |  Square root of `x`   |
| `math.abs(x)`  | Absolute value of `x` |

A `condition` may use one of `>`, `<`, `==`, `>=`, and `<=`.

## message

The result of a `formula` will be compared to its `condition` and inserted
into its `message` format specifier (`%s`).
