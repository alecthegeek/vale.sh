    Over the past 6 years, I've introduced and implemented Vale at 3 different
    jobs in 3 companies (2 of which enterprise scale).

    In addition to giving me and my fellow tech writers more control over the
    quality of the content we put out, it's given me a lot of insight into the
    particular writing habits of non-professional writers and ESL speakers.
    This means I'm able to better anticipate and address the specific style and
    grammar issues that members of this group struggle with, enabling me to
    more effectively coach them, which in turn helps everyone feel better in
    general about contributing to documentation.

    A+++ would recommend to anyone professionally producing and/or processing
    prose today.

    We use vale on all of our internal docs in a docs-as-code pipeline.
    Such a great piece of software! It's powerful, it works, and it's
    customisable.
